# code-refactor

    The purpose of this project is to practice editing html and css of already existing files to be more readable, identifiable, and compressed.

    Changes to the original files include:
        1. Changing html elements to be semantic.
        2. Adding comments to html and css.
        3. Fixing a link error.
        4. Compressing css.
        5. Rearranging code.
